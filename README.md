# SQL and Docker - PERN App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\
It is connected to this [database](https://github.com/hebaulf/pern-server).

<br>

I went through the [The PERN stack with Docker tutorial](https://ellertsmarik.medium.com/the-pern-stack-with-docker-for-beginners-9fa76e574d82) from Sm√°ri and then added another table called "audible", where I listed my Audible listenings, in the database and served that to the app.\
I also added some css styles to make it a little nicer to view.

<br>

**Remember** to run the database and the app at the same time on seperate terminal tabs.

<br>
